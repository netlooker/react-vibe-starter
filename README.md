# React Vibe Starter

A modern React 19 showcase demonstrating "Vibe Coding" principles with Tailwind CSS 4, TypeScript, and Vite. Experience how AI-assisted development can transform your workflow.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe Coding, coined in early 2025, is an intuitive approach to programming that emphasises coding by "feel" rather than strict planning. Developers communicate with AI using natural language to rapidly build interfaces based on the desired "vibe" or experience.

Key characteristics:

- **Intuition-Driven Development**: Making decisions based on what feels right for users
- **Natural Language Prompts**: Using plain language like "make it friendlier" or "add a subtle bounce"
- **Rapid Iteration**: Quick cycles of prompt → code → run → feedback
- **Flow Over Formality**: Maintaining creative momentum without getting bogged down in details

## Showcase Features

- ✨ **Interactive Vibe Demo**: Experience different button "vibes" through a simple interface
- 💬 **Conversation Simulator**: See how developers might "talk" to AI about code changes
- 🔍 **Principles Explorer**: Understand the benefits and challenges of Vibe Coding
- 🌓 **Smart Theme Switching**: Seamless dark/light mode with system preference detection
- 🎨 **Modern UI Elements**: Carefully crafted components with subtle animations

## Tech Stack

- **React 19**: Latest functional components and hooks patterns
- **TypeScript**: Strong type safety with strict mode
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Utility-first styling with custom animations
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast development experience
- **Lucide React**: Crisp, consistent SVG icons

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- npm 9.0 or higher

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/netlooker/react-vibe-starter.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd react-vibe-starter

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to see the application in action.

## Project Structure

The project follows a feature-based organisation pattern:

```

│   ├── components/     # Shared UI components
│   ├── features/       # Feature-specific modules
│   │   ├── hero/       # Hero section components
│   │   ├── principles/ # Vibe coding concepts

│   │   ├── ui/         # Reusable UI elements
│   │   └── vibe-demo/  # Interactive demonstrations
│   ├── App.tsx         # Main application component
│   ├── index.css       # Global styles
│   └── main.tsx        # Application entry point
└── [config files]      # Vite, TypeScript and Tailwind configs
```

## Design Philosophy

This project demonstrates:

- **Feature-Based Code Organisation**: Grouping related components by domain rather than type
- **Component Granularity**: Small, focused components with single responsibilities
- **Responsive Design**: Fully adaptive layout for all devices
- **Animation Subtlety**: Tasteful transitions that enhance rather than distract
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML with proper ARIA attributes

## Try Vibe Coding Yourself

The interactive demo shows how different "vibes" (fun, professional, energetic, calm) translate to different UI implementations through simple language descriptions rather than technical specifications.
